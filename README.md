# U.S. Road Sign Recognition
This repo houses the code used for Computer Vision - ITCS 4152/5152 semester project where we use Deep Learning to detect and recognize road signs.

### This project was done in association with [Good Roads LLC](https://goodroads.io/)

## Group Members
Rockford Stoller - rstolle1@uncc.edu  
Matt Thayer - mthayer2@uncc.edu  
Matt Wells - mwells21@uncc.edu  
Priyaank Chhadwa - pchhadwa@uncc.edu  
Vinith Kantamneni - vkantamn@uncc.edu  

## The Project
Our group was tasked by Good Roads LLC to train and compare deep learning models for detecting U.S. Road Signs.

### Dataset
A subset of the [LISA Dataset](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/LISA/lisa-traffic-sign-dataset.html) was used for training and validation.  
Our [data subset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14sCftCgNk5H2tZlq7EwVYjiEPY6AfTVC/view?usp=sharing) contained grayscale only images that included at least one of the following signs:
* Stop
* Pedestrian Crossing
* Traffic Light Ahead
* Speed Limit 35
* Keep Right

### Models Tested
SSD - Single Shot Detector  
YOLOv3 - You Only Look Once  
RetinaNet
